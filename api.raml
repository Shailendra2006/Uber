        The Price Estimates endpoint returns an estimated price range for each product offered at a given location. The price estimate is provided as a formatted string with the full price range and the localized currency symbol.

        The response also includes low and high estimates, and the ISO 4217 currency code for situations requiring currency conversion. When surge is active for a particular product, its surge_multiplier will be greater than 1, but the price estimate already factors in this multiplier.

        The Request Estimate endpoint allows a ride to be estimated given the desired product, start, and end locations. If the end location is not provided, only the pickup ETA and details of surge pricing information are provided. If the pickup ETA is null, there are no cars available, but an estimate may still be given to the user.

        You can use this endpoint to determine if surge pricing is in effect. Do this before attempting to make a request so that you can preemptively have a user confirm surge by sending them to the surge_confirmation_href provided in the response.
