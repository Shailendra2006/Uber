### Welcome to the RAML API portal for the <a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank"><img src="data:image/png;base64," width="24px">Uber</a>! 

This portal provides 
- a [RAML spec](#REF_TAG_ROOT_RAML) describing the Uber API in a clear, human- and machine-readable format
- [documentation](#REF_TAG_API_REFERENCE) of the Uber API auto-generated from the RAML spec
- the [documentation](#REF_TAG_API_REFERENCE) is live: you can make calls to the Uber API from the documentation
- live, documented usecases for the Uber API, provided as API notebooks, and exercising much of the Uber API

_This portal is built on the Anypoint Platform for APIs, using RAML version 0.8._

_For more information about RAML, see [http://raml.org](http://raml.org)._

_The API notebooks are all executable! Hit "enter" in any code cell to execute it (and all cells before it that have not executed yet), or scroll to the bottom of the notebook and click "Play notebook". For more information, see [http://apinotebook.com](http://apinotebook.com)._
