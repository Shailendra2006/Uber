The API notebooks are all executable! Hit "enter" in any code cell to execute it (and all cells before it that have not executed yet), or scroll to the bottom of the notebook and click "Play notebook". For more information, see [http://apinotebook.com](http://apinotebook.com).

#Considerations

- In order to run these notebooks you must register a Uber account at  [https://get.uber.com/sign-up/](https://get.uber.com/sign-up/).
- You must also register a Uber application [here](https://developer.uber.com/apps/first). Redirect URI of the application must be set to https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/authenticate/oauth.html. At some point of notebook execution, you will be prompted to enter Client ID and Client Secret of your application.
